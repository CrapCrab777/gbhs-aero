  About Us
</h3>
Our goal in the Granite Bay Aeronautics Club is to teach the members how to build, fly, and modify remote control model airplanes. Throughout the first semester we are planning to have the club up and running by having the members modify their own purchased, simple, model aircraft in order to get them to understand the basics of building a model aircraft. Then, later on in the second semester of school we are thinking of creating competitions within the group to motivate the members to think outside the box when completing a given objective. We hope that throughout the span of this club we bring joy, interest, and creativity to those who join.
