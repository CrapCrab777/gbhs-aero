  About Us
</h3>
Our goal in the Granite Bay Aeronautics Club is to teach the members how to build, fly, and modify remote control model airplanes. Throughout the first semester we are planning to have the club up and running by having the members modify their own purchased, simple, model aircraft in order to get them to understand the basics of building a model aircraft. Then, later on in the second semester of school we are thinking of creating competitions within the group to motivate the members to think outside the box when completing a given objective. We hope that throughout the span of this club we bring joy, interest, and creativity to those who join.

Scheduling
</h3>
Currently the meetings for the GBAC are held in campus in room 921 (Mr. Moore’s Room) every Thursday from 3:40 to 4:15. Every three weeks or so we will meet up in Maidu Park and fly the model plane’s together whether it is to test them, hold a competition, or just have fun. However, this scheduling will not be 100% consistent especially during times like Midterms, Finals, and AP tests the meeting times might be moved around. If you have any questions regarding scheduling, again, email me at deniz.sumer@student.rjuhsd.us.

Future Meetups (Live):
October 13, 2022 - Room 921
October 20, 2022 - Room 921
October 27, 2022 - Room 921
November 4, 2022 - Room 921

Here I will provide all of the resources needed to get started building, modifying, flying your plane! During every day of the club i go through a slide show presentation that, not only provides a visual aid, but also includes links to helpful websites. The link for the slideshow presentation is provided here.
To save you from fishing around in  the slide show presentation I will link all of the helpful stuff here:
