    Scheduling
  </h3>
  
<p id="text">
    Currently the meetings for the GBAC are held in campus in room 921 (Mr. Moore’s Room) every Thursday from 3:40 to 4:15. Every three weeks or so we will meet up in Maidu Park and fly the model plane’s together whether it is to test them, hold a competition, or just have fun. However, this scheduling will not be 100% consistent especially during times like Midterms, Finals, and AP tests the meeting times might be moved around. If you have any questions regarding scheduling, again, email me at deniz.sumer@student.rjuhsd.us.
